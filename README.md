# Quality-related research funding scenarios

The purpose of this Python Dash app is to test different scenarios for mainstream quality-related research funding in England.

Quality-related research funding is government funding for institutions based on the quality of their research. It is managed by the devolved governments. The 'mainstream' element is the vast bulk of funding. There are separate elements for supervising postgraduate researchers and working with businesses and charities.

Mainstream allocations are based on the results of research assessments run by the Government. The latest was the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021. The results were released May 2022. We are yet (as of June 2022) to hear what allocations will eb for next year, or exactly what process will be followed.

The REF grades research submitted by institutions at different quality levels, denoted by a start grading system (4 the highest).

This app assumes a similar process to last time. Crucially, though, it allows users to adjust the weightings to test how this may affect allocations.

Of course, this could all prove horribly wrong, but it's not a bad tool for the CV all the same...

The app is available on [Heroku](https://qr-modelling.herokuapp.com/), with [further details about methodology](https://qr-modelling.herokuapp.com/about) included.
